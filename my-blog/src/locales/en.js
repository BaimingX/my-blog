      title: 'My AI Philosophy',
      content: 'To me, AI is not just a tool; it is a battle-tested co-pilot that amplifies my cognition. Before writing a single line of AI-assisted code, I design a clear architectural blueprint, define coding conventions, and curate a prompt library that keeps large language models both creative and on-spec. Every feature is decomposed into self-contained, reusable modules so the final product snaps together with surgical precision.'

      title: 'AI-First Workflow',
      content: 'My AI-First workflow spans the entire product lifecycle: rapid ideation with ChatGPT, Claude, or Ollama; automated pipelines powered by LangChain, LlamaIndex, and OpenAI Function Calling; and friction-free releases via generative scripts and Docker Compose that push straight to the cloud.'

    section3: {
      title: 'Collaboration & Integration',
      content: 'During AI Pair Programming, the model and I co-author requirements, unit tests, code reviews, and documentation, achieving minute-level iteration loops. In AI-Driven DevOps, containerized templates compress the path from laptop to production down to a single command. Along the way, I leverage best-of-breed open-source projects—forked, dockerized, and woven into a microservice mesh—to form a fully modular, repeatable personal pipeline.'
